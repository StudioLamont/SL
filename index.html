<span class="pilcrow">¶</span> Studio Lamont is a book design and typography studio specialising in printed books, with a focus on fine lettering and elegant layout. Our work is rooted in a hands-on knowledge of bookcraft, from thread to flyleaf. We take an artisan’s approach to all we do, whether we’re producing a limited artist’s edition or a mass-market paperback.<br> 
	
	<span class="pilcrow">¶</span> The studio’s clients include publishers, universities, museums, libraries, and authors. If you need a beautifully crafted book or printed object, produced to the highest standards, email us to discuss your project: luke[at]studiolamont.com.<br>
	
<span class="pilcrow">¶</span> The studio is headed by Luke Allan, who received his <span class="sc">mf</span><span class="sc-last">a</span> in Book Arts from the Center for the Book, University of Iowa, where he taught book design and trained as a calligrapher, bookbinder, paper-maker, and letterpress printer. He is a doctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge, researching poetry and typography. <br>
