<span class="pilcrow">¶</span> Studio Lamont is a book design and typography studio specialising in good old-fashioned printed books, with fine lettering and elegant layouts. Our work is rooted in a hands-on knowledge of bookcraft, from thread to flyleaf. We take an artisan’s approach to all the work we do, whether we’re making a limited artist’s edition or a mass-market paperback.<br> 
<span class="pilcrow">¶</span> The studio is headed by Luke Allan, who received his <span class="sc">mf</span><span class="sc-last">a</span> in Book Arts from the Center for the Book, University of Iowa, where he trained as a calligrapher, bookbinder, paper-maker, and letterpress printer, and taught book design. He is currently completing doctoral research on poetry and typography at the University of Cambridge, and designing a typeface.<br><span class="pilcrow">¶</span> The studio’s clients include publishing houses, universities, libraries, and authors. If you need a beautifully crafted book or printed object, produced to the highest standards, we’re here for you. <br>
